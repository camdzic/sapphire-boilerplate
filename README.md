# sapphire-boilerplate

This boilerplate is bootstrapped from the [Sapphire CLI](https://sapphirejs.dev/docs/Guide/CLI/introduction) and serves as a simple starting point for creating a new Sapphire project. I have added my own Prettier configuration and made a few other small changes to suit my preferences.
